# Neonmarker

## Backlog/TODO

### Order of tag rules can be dynamically changed in UI
drag and drop
move up / move down arrows next to rule definitions

### colour mappings can be added in scripts
extNeonmarker.addColormapping("tag", 0xc06000)
probably not that good of an idea ater all?

### user can add colour by regex
UI configurable passive scanning rule
Custom Tagger extension?

### user can save colour mappings between sessions and projects
database?
xml?
ZAP preference file?

### user can diable the colouring tepmporarily using the UI panel
enable/disable button in panel toolbar

### IDEAS
 
Designer-picked colours "koodariv√§rit"
