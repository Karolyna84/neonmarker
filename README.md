# Neonmarker

## Backlog/TODO

### Order of tag rules can be dynamically changed in UI
- drag and drop?

### Colour mappings can be added in scripts
- extNeonmarker.addColormapping("tag", 0xc06000)
- probably not that good of an idea ater all?

### User can add colour by regex
- UI configurable passive scanning rule
- Custom Tagger extension?

### User can save colour mappings between sessions and projects
- database?
- xml?
- ZAP preference file?

### User can diable the colouring tepmporarily using the UI panel
- enable/disable button in panel toolbar

### IDEAS
- Designer-picked colours "koodariv√§rit"
