# Neonmarker

Continuation of the Zaproxy Neonmarker addon by [@juhakivekas](https://github.com/juhakivekas).

Neonmarker is a [@zaproxy](https://github.com/zaproxy/) addon which facilitates colouring of History table entries based on the Tags that have been applied to them 
(either by the Passive scanner or manually).

## Backlog/TODO

### Order of tag rules can be dynamically changed in UI
- drag and drop?

### User can add colour by regex
- UI configurable passive scanning rule
- Custom Tagger extension?

### User can save colour mappings between sessions and projects
- database?
- xml?
- ZAP preference file?

### IDEAS
- Designer-picked colours "koodariv√§rit"
